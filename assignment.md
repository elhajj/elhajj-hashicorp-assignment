## What Is the Difference Between Push, Pull, and Fetch?

- `git push` - sends changes from a local branch to a remote repo
- `git fetch` - gets changes from a remote repo into your tracking branch
- `git pull` - gets changes from a remote branch into your tracking branch and merges them into a local branch

People often describe `git push` and `git pull` as equivalent. This isn't entirely correct, since under the hood `git pull` does two things. `git push` takes our current branch, and checks to see whether or not there is a tracking branch for a remote repository connected to it. If so, git takes changes from our branch and pushes to the remote branch. This is how you share code with a remote repository; you can think of it as "make the remote branch resemble my local branch". This fails if the remote branch has diverged from your local branch: if not all the commits in the remote branch are in your local branch. When this happens, you need to synchronize your local branch with the remote branch with git pull or git fetch and git merge. `git fetch` again takes our current branch, and checks to see if there is a tracking branch. If so, it looks for changes in the remote branch, and pulls them into the tracking branch. It does not change your local branch. To do that, you need to do `git merge origin/master` (for the "master" branch) to merge those changes into your branch - probably also called "master". `git pull` simply does a `git fetch` followed immediately by `git merge`. This is often what we desire to do, but some people prefer to use git fetch followed by git merge to make sure they understand the changes they are merging into their branch before the merge happens.
